The server then accesses the URL and shares its results, which may include sensitive information such as AWS metadata, internal configuration information, or database contents with the attacker. Because the request comes from the back end, it bypasses access controls, potentially exposing information the user does not have sufficient privileges to receive. The attacker can then exploit this information to gain access, modify the web application, or demand a ransom payment.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Blacklists are problematic and attackers have numerous ways to bypass them; ideally, use a whitelist of all permitted domains and IP addresses.\n* Use authentication even within your own network to prevent exploitation of server-side requests.\n* Implement zero trust and sanitize and validate all URL and header data returning to the server from the user. Strip invalid or suspect characters, then inspect to be certain it contains a valid and expected value.\n* Ideally, avoid sending server requests based on user-provided data altogether.\n* Ensure that you are not sending raw response bodies from the server directly to the client. Only deliver expected responses.\n* Disable suspect and exploitable URL schemas. Common culprits include obscure and little-used schemas such as `file://`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, and `gopher://`.",

The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks, in which an attacker gains access to sensitive session information and uses this information to trick legitimate web-based applications into disclosing confidential information or accepting illegitimate requests. When developers use the `HttpOnly` flag to set the cookie, they ensure that this sensitive session information is not readable or writable except by the browser (read) and server (write), respectively. While most modern browsers and versions now recognize the HttpOnly flag, some legacy and custom browsers still do not.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Include the `HttpOnly` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side. Be aware, however, that this crucial step provides only partial remediation.\n* Integrate client-side scripts to determine browser version; require browser compatibility or avoid transmitting sensitive data to browsers that do not support `HttpOnly`.\n* Understand and evaluate risks of third-party components or plugins, which may expose cookies.\n* Educate developers in a zero-trust approach, understanding the risks and best practices to prevent cross-site scripting, such as sanitizing all user input for code and special characters.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature. For example, if a resource has moved to a new location, URL redirection can transfer the user to that location rather than displaying an error message.\nHowever, this ability can be exploited through social engineering, tricking the user into believing they are accessing one site when, in reality, they are being redirected to a dangerous site, such as a phishing site. Once there, the user may be further tricked into entering credentials or personally identifiable information (PII), believing they are still within the original, trusted domain. Attackers can then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access or leverage the user's PII for sale or ransom.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* When developing a site or web app, consider implementing a disclaimer page to remind users that they are leaving a secure site.\n* Adopt a zero-trust approach in which all input is treated with suspicion.\n* Validate all input against deny-lists to ensure it does not contain code to redirect the user. This method is good but inherently incomplete.\n* Be aware of all sources of untrusted input being sent to the server that could be used to redirect the user, such as cookies, URL components, filenames, query results, request headers, and more.\n* In particular, be aware of potential API calls that could send input indirectly to redirect the user.\n* To protect end users, use a firewall to block known malicious sites, train users to recognize basic signs of a phishing attack, and ensure that all network endpoints are patched with the most current updates.",

Repositories created under organizations inherit the organization permissions. The organizations or repositories created before February 2023 have the default permissions set to read-write. Often these permissions do not adhere to the principle of least privilege and can be reduced to read-only, leaving the `write` permission only to a specific types as `issues: write` or `pull-requests: write`.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nAdd the `permissions` key to the job or the root of workflow (in this case it is applied to all jobs in the workflow that do not have their own `permissions` key) and assign the least privileges required to complete the task:\n\n```yaml\nname: \"My workflow\"\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  pull-requests: write\n```\n\nor\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)\n",

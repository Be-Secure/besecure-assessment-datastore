Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge;copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.;copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose an;copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.;Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:;Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.;copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:;copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.

TiledOutputFile was incorrectly interleaving channels and scanlines before passing pixel data to a compressor. The lossless compressors still work, but lossy compressors do not. Fix the bug by interleaving channels and scanlines in tiled files in the same way as ScanLineOutputFile does. Programs compiled with the new version of IlmImf cannot read tiled images produced with version 1.1.0. (Florian Kainz) IlmImf: ImfXdr.h fix for 64-bit architectures. (Florian Kainz) IlmImf: OpenEXR now supports YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha) images with subsampled chroma channels. When an image is written with the RGBA convenience interface, selecting WRITE_YCA instead of WRITE_RGBA causes the library to convert the pixels to YCA format. If WRITE_Y is selected, only luminance is stored in the file (for black and white images). When an image file is read with the RGBA conv"

Revised comments on png_set_progressive_read_fn() in libpng.txt and example.c Added information about debugging in libpng.txt and libpng.3 . Changed \"ln -sf\" to \"ln -s -f\" in makefile.s2x, makefile.lnx, and makefile.sco. Removed lines after Dynamic Dependencies\" in makefile.aco . Revised makefile.dec to make a shared library (Jeremie Petit). Removed trailing blanks from all files.;copyright/disclaimer/license notice. Added contrib/msvctest directory;copyright year accordingly. More cleanup of configure.ac, Makefile.am, and associated scripts. Restored scripts/makefile.elf which was inadvertently deleted.;copyright year in scripts/pngwin.def (Cosmin). Removed PNG_TYPECAST_NULL and used standard NULL consistently (Cosmin). Disallowed the user to redefine png_size_t, and enforced a consistent use of png_size_t across libpng (Cosmin). Changed the type of png_ptr->rowbytes, PNG_ROWBYTES() and friends to png_size_t (Cosmin). Removed png_convert_size() and replaced png_sizeof with sizeof (Cosmin). Removed some unnecessary type casts (Cosmin). Changed prototype of png_get_compression_buffer_size() and png_set_compression_buffer_size() to work with png_size_t instead of png_uint_32 (Cosmin). Removed png_memcpy_check() and png_memset_check() (Cosmin). Fixed a typo (png_byte --> png_bytep) in libpng.3 and libpng.txt (Cosmin). Clarified that png_zalloc() does not clear the allocated memory, and png_zalloc() and png_zfree() cannot be PNGAPI (Cosmin). Renamed png_mem_size_t to png_alloc_size_t, fixed its definition in pngconf.h, and used it in all memory;COPYRIGHT macro.

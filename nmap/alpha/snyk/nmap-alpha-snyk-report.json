Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

The XML processor then uses the system identifier to access the resource rather than using the URI. When this weakness exists, the application permits user-supplied data, which could include the address of an XML external identity, to be passed directly to the XML parser. The application will then attempt to retrieve documents from outside of secure, controlled areas.\n\nAttackers can exploit this weakness to expose sensitive data, execute port scanning on the server side, or launch a denial-of-service attack (DoS) such as Billion Laughs.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using vulnerable APIs\n* When possible, disable loading of data from external entities. The method of doing this will vary based on the language and XML parser being used.\n* Use a local, static document type definitions (DTDs) and ensure that external DTDs are disallowed entirely.\n* If user input cannot be avoided, perform validation against an allowlist of possible data sources. However, as long as external DTDs are allowed, XML code remains inherently vulnerable to attacks exploiting this weakness.\n\n\n## References\n* [XML vulnerabilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities)",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

Use of this function could lead to memory corruption attacks if arbitrary user input (which has not been validated in terms of its length) is allowed to flow into it. It is advisable to use the safer alternative instead, which is less prone to memory corruption issues.\n\nA buffer overflow is a type of runtime error that allows a program to write past the end of a buffer or array — hence the name overflow — and corrupt adjacent memory. Like most bugs, a buffer overflow doesn’t manifest at every program execution. Instead, the vulnerability is triggered under certain circumstances, such as unexpected user input.\n\nA buffer overflow attack is the exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability — typically by a malicious actor who wants to gain access or information, or trigger a crash to deny service to others. Buffer overflows generally result in program crashes, however under certain circumstances, an attacker may be able to trigger remote code execution.",

The XML processor then uses the system identifier to access the resource rather than using the URI. When this weakness exists, the application permits user-supplied data, which could include the address of an XML external identity, to be passed directly to the XML parser. The application will then attempt to retrieve documents from outside of secure, controlled areas.\n\nAttackers can exploit this weakness to expose sensitive data, execute port scanning on the server side, or launch a denial-of-service attack (DoS) such as Billion Laughs.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using vulnerable APIs\n* When possible, disable loading of data from external entities. The method of doing this will vary based on the language and XML parser being used.\n* Use a local, static document type definitions (DTDs) and ensure that external DTDs are disallowed entirely.\n* If user input cannot be avoided, perform validation against an allowlist of possible data sources. However, as long as external DTDs are allowed, XML code remains inherently vulnerable to attacks exploiting this weakness.\n\n\n## References\n* [XML vulnerabilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities)",

Like most bugs, a buffer overflow doesn’t manifest at every program execution. Instead, the vulnerability is triggered under certain circumstances, such as unexpected user input.\n\nA buffer overflow attack is the exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability — typically by a malicious actor who wants to gain access or information. In this post, we’ll explain how a buffer overflow occurs and show you how to protect your C++ code from these attacks. Buffer overflows generally result in program crashes, however if the data that would overflow is user controlled, an attacker may cause more damage including deny of service attacks, infinite loops, or even remote code execution.",

Like most bugs, a buffer overflow doesn’t manifest at every program execution. Instead, the vulnerability is triggered under certain circumstances, such as unexpected user input.\n\nA buffer overflow attack is the exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability — typically by a malicious actor who wants to gain access or information. In this post, we’ll explain how a buffer overflow occurs and show you how to protect your C++ code from these attacks. Buffer overflows generally result in program crashes, however if the data that would overflow is user controlled, an attacker may cause more damage including deny of service attacks, infinite loops, or even remote code execution.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nAn integer overflow is a type of an arithmetic overflow error when the result of an integer operation does not fit within the allocated memory space. Instead of an error in the program, it usually causes the result to be unexpected. In the context of application security, this could lead to bypass of application logic or validation, and in some cases may lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nnresp = packet_get_int();\nif (nresp > 0) {\n response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));\n for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)\n  response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);\n}\n```\n\nIf `nresp` is 1073741824 and `sizeof(char*)` is 4 (which is typical), then `nresp*sizeof(char*)` results in an overflow. Therefore, `xmalloc()` receives and allocates a 0-byte buffer. The subsequent loop causes a heap buffer overflow, which may, in turn, be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\nInteger overflow can be hard to detect and prevent, especially in large and complex codebases. Developers should perform checks as appropriate to determine that arithmetic operations do not result in an overflow. This could be as simple as ensuring the result of the additive operation is not less than the operands themselves (and the inverse for subtractive operations). Libraries and processes can help to prevent such issues too - in the case of the GCC compiler, for example, there are built-in functions that check for integer overflows. In the case of C++ programs, there is a library called SafeInt that performs safe operations.\n\n## References\n\n* [CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)",

This typically leads to information leaks or buffer overflows and occurs when:\n* There is an off-by-one error which leads to the null character being out of bounds\n* Raw data is passed to functions expecting strings. This can lead to out of bounds reading or writing (e.g., strlen / strcpy using raw data)\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use functions that ensure proper null termination. Pay attention to the way the string functions affect the ending null character (e.g., strncpy doesn't necessarily ensure null termination)\n* Avoid passing raw data to functions expecting strings. If this can't be avoided ensure there is proper null termination (e.g., write a null character at the end of the buffer)",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nAn integer overflow is a type of an arithmetic overflow error when the result of an integer operation does not fit within the allocated memory space. Instead of an error in the program, it usually causes the result to be unexpected. In the context of application security, this could lead to bypass of application logic or validation, and in some cases may lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nnresp = packet_get_int();\nif (nresp > 0) {\n response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));\n for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)\n  response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);\n}\n```\n\nIf `nresp` is 1073741824 and `sizeof(char*)` is 4 (which is typical), then `nresp*sizeof(char*)` results in an overflow. Therefore, `xmalloc()` receives and allocates a 0-byte buffer. The subsequent loop causes a heap buffer overflow, which may, in turn, be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\nInteger overflow can be hard to detect and prevent, especially in large and complex codebases. Developers should perform checks as appropriate to determine that arithmetic operations do not result in an overflow. This could be as simple as ensuring the result of the additive operation is not less than the operands themselves (and the inverse for subtractive operations). Libraries and processes can help to prevent such issues too - in the case of the GCC compiler, for example, there are built-in functions that check for integer overflows. In the case of C++ programs, there is a library called SafeInt that performs safe operations.\n\n## References\n\n* [CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)",

Attackers can then view, export, modify, and delete confidential information; change passwords and other authentication information; and possibly gain access to other systems within the network. This is one of the most commonly exploited categories of vulnerability, but can largely be avoided through good coding practices.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid passing user-entered parameters directly to the SQL server.\n* Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries from user-entered parameters.\n* When coding, define SQL code first, then pass in parameters. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries. Examples include `SqlCommand()` in .NET and `bindParam()` in PHP.\n* Use strong typing for all parameters so unexpected user data will be rejected.\n* Where direct user input cannot be avoided for performance reasons, validate input against a very strict allowlist of permitted characters, avoiding special characters such as `? & / < > ; - ' \" \\` and spaces. Use a vendor-supplied escaping routine if possible.\n* Develop your application in an environment and/or using libraries that provide protection against SQL injection.\n* Harden your entire environment around a least-privilege model, ideally with isolated accounts with privileges only for particular tasks.",
